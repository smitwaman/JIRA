   - **Approval Workflow**:
     1. Submit the change request: Submit the change request for review and approval within Jira.
     2. Approval process: Define a custom approval workflow in Jira, specifying multiple approval stages and approvers for the change request.

     2. Document impacts in Jira: Record change impacts, risk assessments, and mitigation strategies in the change request ticket for reference.

3. **Service Desk**:

   - **Ticket Creation and Routing**:
     1. Submit service requests: Users submit service requests or incident reports through the Jira Service Desk portal or email.
     2. Automatic ticket creation: Jira automatically creates tickets for incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate queues or teams.

   - **Knowledge Base Integration**:
     1. Populate the knowledge base: Populate the knowledge base with troubleshooting guides, FAQs, and solutions to common issues.
     2. Link knowledge base articles: Link relevant knowledge base articles to service desk tickets in Jira to facilitate self-service support options for users.
   
   - **Escalation and Collaboration**:
     1. Escalate tickets: Escalate tickets to higher-level support groups or subject matter experts as needed.
     2. Collaboration: Collaborate within Jira to troubleshoot and resolve incidents, ensuring effective communication and resolution tracking.

By following these steps and leveraging Jira's capabilities, IT Operations teams can effectively manage incidents, changes, and service requests, ensuring smooth operations and timely resolution of issues.
